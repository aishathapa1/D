## What's the Difference?

While blogging can be a component of a larger content marketing strategy, it's not the whole picture. Let's break down the key differences:

*   **Purpose:** Blogging focuses on publishing regular content to attract readers. Content marketing uses content (blog posts, videos, infographics) to achieve specific business goals, such as lead generation or increased sales.
*   **Strategy:** Blogging often lacks a formal strategy beyond consistent posting. Content marketing involves detailed planning, audience research, keyword analysis, and ROI tracking.
*   **Audience Focus:** Blogging targets general interests, while content marketing caters to a specific audience with carefully crafted content that solves their problems.
